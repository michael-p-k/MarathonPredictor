This is a data science project I created to scrape marathon times, weather data, and elevation data in order to predict marathon times.

The data visualization and predictive modeling is contained in the MarathonPredictor.ipynb jupyter notebook. You will also need the most recent data table csv from the full_df_csvs folder.

If you are interested in my code for scraping data and compiling my data set, please take a look at the MarathonDataCollection.ipynb jupyter notebook.
